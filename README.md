## About

If you are interested in data science, you will find some material on this blog. I am Michele Usuelli and here you will find links to my books, articles and conference speechs. I currently work at Microsoft as a Principal Data Scientist.

Coming from [Revolution Analytics](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/), one of the start-ups that [brought data science to Microsoft](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-finalizes-its-revolution-analytics-acquisition/), I joined Microsoft Consultancy Services and helped defining the brand new role of Microsoft Data Scientist Consultant, working in a worldwide team. In my day-to-day job, I like designing data science engagements and facilitating the project delivery. To share material across the Microsoft, I had the role of EMEA Lead for the Advanced Analytics Worldwide Community.

## My conferences

- July 14 2019: spoken at the Microsoft Ready conference in Las Vegas.

- November 10 2018: spoken at the [Sberbank Data Science Journey in Moscow](https://sdsj.sberbank.ai/ru/day), largest Machine Learning conference in Russia and Eastern Europe. The [video recording](https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/9rfd8seq0m) is available and my part starts around the 2nd hour, fully dubbed in Russian. The topic was a technical deep-dive into a use-case I worked on during a few projects.

## My articles

My latest articles explain data science in a simple manner, aiming to demystify the topic.

My first articles are more technical and they show how to run data science experiments on a large scale using tools like R and Hadoop.
