I joined Microsoft after the acquisition of [Revolution Analytics](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/), one of the start-ups that [brought data science to Microsoft](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-finalizes-its-revolution-analytics-acquisition/). Working in a worldwide team as a Lead Data Scientist, I helped  to define the brand-new role of Microsoft Data Scientist Consultant. At Microsoft Enterprise Services, I led the delivery of 3 large data science projects, with the solution deployed in production, and of 7 smaller projects. As part of my role, I cover all the data science aspects, including business discovery, solution architecture, delivery practice and technical implementation. To contribute to the data science community, I spoke at 10 worldwide conferences and had the role of EMEA Lead for the Advanced Analytics Worldwide Community of Microsoft.
