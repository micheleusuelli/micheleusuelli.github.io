## About

Are you working on Artificial Intelligence, Data Science or Big Data? Or perhaps just curious? Here you might find something of your interest.

People first. Problems next. Data and technology are an enabler. With that perspective in mind, I gathered some thoughts in my [articles](pages/articles.md), [conferences](pages/conferences.md) and [books](pages/books.md). I hope you can make use of them.

If you are interested in my background, I am currently working at Microsoft as a Principal Data Scientist. You can find more information on [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michele-usuelli-1b84b460). If you have any feedback, ideas, questions, or simply want to get in touch, that's where you can find me.

## What is data science

Data science is, arguably, a recent buzzword. What does it really mean? I saw different perspectives, related to individual experiences. My perspective is just a reflection of the applications I have seen so far.

I worked on scenarios such as resource planning, pricing, recommendations. They all involved a decision, more effective if supported by facts. The relevant data was too complex to be analysed with statistical tools, therefore the need for software to use the information automatically.

A key of this type of tools is unpredictability. First, the data is not always trustworthy. Second, the way the algorithms learn from the data is not necessarily correct. To effectively use the data and to handle the uncertainty, the algorithms are designed using statistics. "Machine learning" is this type of software. Data science, in my opinion, is the field of developing the software and using it for the scenarios.

What is your view of data science? I hope you enjoyed seeing my perspective.
