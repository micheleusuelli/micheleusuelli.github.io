Coming from [Revolution Analytics](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/), one of the start-ups that [brought data science to Microsoft](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-finalizes-its-revolution-analytics-acquisition/), I joined Microsoft Consultancy Services and helped defining the brand new role of Microsoft Data Scientist Consultant, working in a worldwide team. In my day-to-day job, I like designing data science engagements and facilitating the project delivery. To share material across the Microsoft, I had the role of EMEA Lead for the Advanced Analytics Worldwide Community.
