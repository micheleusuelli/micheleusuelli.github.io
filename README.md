## About

Mathematician by background, I love simplicity and applications to the real world

Currently working at Microsoft as a Principal Data Science Manager for Energy & Sustainability. I support large companies on their digital transformation by rapidly prototyping data science solutions, then deploying them into products with the help of the Azure cloud.


## Why I write

I have been writing books and articles since the first years of my career, reflecting on the fundamentals of data science. Besides being passionate about the field, sharing my perspective helped me a lot to reflect on the "why".

Also, I hope that others can be more effective in their job, wether they are Data Scientists or Citizen Data Scientists.

Last, even more important, writing gave me the opportunity to hear from other field practitioners, perhaps challenging my point of view so that we can all see the problems from different angles and grow together.

If you are either a data scientist or curious about the subject, here you can find my perspective about the field. If you would like to connect, you can reach out from [my LinkedIn profile](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michele-usuelli-1b84b460).

In this blog you can find my [articles](pages/articles.md),  [books](pages/books.md) and [conferences](pages/conferences.md).
