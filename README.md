## About

If you are interested in data science, you will find some material on this blog. I am Michele Usuelli and here you will find links to my books, articles and conference speechs. I currently work at Microsoft as a Principal Data Scientist. This is my [full work experience](pages/biography.md).

If you have any feedback, ideas, questions, or simply want to get in touch, let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michele-usuelli-1b84b460).

## My articles

My latest articles explain data science in a simple manner, aiming to demystify the topic.

My first articles are more technical and they show how to run data science experiments on a large scale using tools like R and Hadoop.
