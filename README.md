## About

Are you working on Artificial Intelligence, Data Science or Big Data? Or perhaps just curious? Here you might find something of your interest.

People first. Problems next. Data and technology are an enabler. With that perspective in mind, I gathered some thoughts in my [articles](pages/articles.md), [conferences](pages/conferences.md) and [books](pages/books.md). I hope you can make use of them.

If you are interested in my background, I am currently working at Microsoft as a Principal Data Scientist. You can find more information on [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michele-usuelli-1b84b460). If you have any feedback, ideas, questions, or simply want to get in touch, that's where you can find me.
