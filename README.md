## About

I am Michele Usuelli and I work at Microsoft as a Lead Data Scientist. Here you will find links to my books, articles, presentations and academic thesis. Currently, my key goal is to demystify data science and artificial intelligence. Previously, a recurrent topic is using R with Hadoop and Spark.

If you have any questions or simply want to get in touch, feel free to reach out to me at [my LinkedIn profile](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michele-usuelli-1b84b460).

On April 17-19, I spoke at the [IKEA Tech festival in Shanghai](https://berndhessbruegge.wixsite.com/ikea-tech-festival-2)

On November 10, I spoke at the [Sberbank Data Science Journey in Moscow](https://sdsj.sberbank.ai/ru/day).

On November 29, I'll be speaking at the [Machine Learning Innovation Summit in Dublin](https://www.theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/machine-learning-summit-dublin-2018/overview).
