## My articles

People, problems, data, technology. This is my view of data science. In my career, I followed it backwards, as reflected by the articles. My latest articles focus on delivery practices, with a people-first mindset. On the other hand, my initial articles are more technical, covering machine learning techniques and big data technology.

I really hope you can benefit from this material, either having more clarity on the subject or help on the way you shape your work.
