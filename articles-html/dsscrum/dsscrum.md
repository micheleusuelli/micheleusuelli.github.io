Delivering a data science project, common challenges are
- **confusion**: data science experimentation disconnected from real-world business value
- **lack of quick results**: the experimentation can be slow and not lead to any short-term results, resulting in a lack of stakeholder engagement
- **lack of quality**: the solution doesn't meets some quality standards, especially from a computer science perspective

If you relate to either of these challenges, in this article I am sharing some lessons learned from a few projects I have been working on.

The objectives of the delivery methodology are
- **clarity**: map high-level business requirements with low-level technical capabilities
- **velocity**: deliver the project quickly and in small increments
- **quality**: ensure that the product meets the quality standards
