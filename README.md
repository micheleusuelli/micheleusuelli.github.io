## What is data science

Data science is, arguably, a recent buzzword. What does it really mean? I saw different perspectives, related to individual experiences. My perspective is just a reflection of the applications I have seen so far.

I worked on scenarios such as resource planning, pricing, recommendations. They all involved a decision, more effective if supported by facts. The relevant data was too complex to be analysed with statistical tools, therefore the need for software to use the information automatically.

A key of this type of tools is unpredictability. First, the data is not always trustworthy. Second, the way the algorithms learn from the data is not necessarily correct. To effectively use the data and to handle the uncertainty, the algorithms are designed using statistics. "Machine learning" is this type of software. Data science, in my opinion, is the field of developing this type of applications. 

The first step is to define the outcome supporting the scenarios. There are one or more users who take action, for example planning  resources, setting the price, recommending products. What choices do they have? What information do they need to make effective choices? Where is the related data? Once the target outcome is defined, the second step consists in accessing the related data to understand what is feasible. The work consists in experimenting with the data to design machine learning algorithms. Finally, to have a product using the data automatically, the last step is to develop a software application. Machine learning techniques often need powerful and flexible computers. Cloud computing can provide the power and flexibility, especially if the solution neds to be replicated many times.

What is your view of data science? I hope you enjoyed seeing my perspective.
