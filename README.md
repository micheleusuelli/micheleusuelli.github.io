- 2018 November 10, Moscow: spoken at the [Sberbank Data Science Journey](https://sdsj.sberbank.ai/ru/day), largest Machine Learning conference in Russia and Eastern Europe. The [video recording](https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/9rfd8seq0m) is available and my part starts around the 2nd hour, fully dubbed in Russian. The topic was a technical deep-dive into a use-case I worked on during a few projects.

## My articles

My latest articles explain data science in a simple manner, aiming to demystify the topic.

My first articles are more technical and they show how to run data science experiments on a large scale using tools like R and Hadoop.
