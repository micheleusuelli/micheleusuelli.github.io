
# Agile delivery of data science projects (DRAFT)

Author: Michele Usuelli

## Objectives

Delivering a data science project, common challenges are
- **confusion**: data science experimentation disconnected from real-world business value
- **lack of quick results**: the experimentation can be slow and not lead to any short-term results, resulting in a lack of stakeholder engagement
- **lack of quality**: the solution doesn't meets some quality standards, especially from a computer science perspective

If you relate to either of these challenges, in this article I am sharing some lessons learned from a few projects I have been working on.

The objectives of the delivery methodology are
- **clarity**: map high-level business requirements with low-level technical capabilities
- **velocity**: deliver the project quickly and in small increments
- **quality**: ensure that the product meets the quality standards


## Personas and delivery methodology

To simplify, there are three key actors
- data scientist: conduct analytical experiments
- data engineer: prepare the data, put data science solutions into productoin
- solution architect: design the technical infrastructure

Besides, there are other roles such as
- product owner: prioritise work per business value
- subject-matter experts: provide data and input to data scientists
- scrum master: facilitate the delivery

The delivery process is based on the [Microsoft TDSP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview) (Team Data Science Process).

## Project set-up

To set-up the project, there are usually three phases
- Business discovery
- Analytical discovery
- Technical discovery

The outcome of the project set-up is
- A document describing the vision and objecties
- An initial list of data science activity together with an assessment of the complexity

This article focuses on the delivery of each data science activity.

```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
```
