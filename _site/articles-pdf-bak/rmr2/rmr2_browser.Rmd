*rmr2* is an R package designed to write scalable algorithms. This package is connector between R and Hadoop and it allows to write MapReduce jobs using Hadoop Streaming. MapReduce is a low-level paradigm to write algorithms that run in parallel. Scaling a data analysis or Machine Learning technique may require re-writing some steps in MapReduce. Some algorithms can be easily re-written in MapReduce, some others require some changes, others can't be parallelized at all.

Using a low-level tool like *rmr2* requires a lot of testing and debugging. For this purpose, it's possible to use a local computing context to test the algorithms in-memory on a small data sample. The following example shows how to perform a word-count on some sample data.

```{r rmr2_browser.R, cache=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
read_chunk("../rmr2/rmr2_browser.R")
```

```{r prepare-data}
```

```{r word-count-map}
```

```{r word-count-reduce}
```

```{r iris-map}
```

```{r word-count}
```

```{r iris}
```


The algorithm is split

We have been able to run and test *rmr2* in-memory. However, the algorithm is still a black-box in the sense that we don't know what happened within inside each step. Furthermore, we don't know about the input of the reduce step.

A solution is interrupting the execution R code before each reduce step using `browser`. 

```{r}
```
