<p>To build and apply a predictive model, a popular technique is called <em>decision forest</em>. It popularity is due to its versatility and minimality of data preparation requirements.
This article explains the technique without requiring any technical background. By the end of this article, you will get these takeaways</p>

<li><p>Analogies with the human problem-solving approach
To demonstrate this, we use as an example a mock use-case based on simulated data. Please be aware that the assumptions behind the example are not necessarily related to reality.
A bank gives loans to its customer. The goal is to understand what customers are trustworthy enough to receive a loan. The bank can use some information related to the customer such as </p></li>

<li><p><strong>Credit score</strong>: score measuring the “reliability” of the customer, assessed by a third party</p></li>

<li><p><strong>House age</strong>: age of the house they’re purchasing</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Years of employment</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Credit card debt</strong>: Debt on the credit card</p></li>

<li><p><strong>House year</strong>: Year in which they purchased the house
The bank collected historical data about its previous customers. Besides, it traced what customers defaulted via a <strong>default</strong> column. For showing purposes, half of the previous customer defaulted.
| Credit score | House age | Years of employment | Credit card debt | House year
|---|---|---|---|---|
708|21|5|4190|2002|0|
649|20|3|2151|2003|0|
725|23|3|3603|2005|0|
785|24|4|5534|2009|0|
649|14|6|5243|2002|0|
734|21|0|3441|2008|0|
Via a statistical metric, we can identify the most default-related information, e.g. the credit card debt. Setting a threshold, we can divide the bank customers into two groups.
Then, for each of the two groups, we repeat the process of finding the most relevant feature and we split the customers into two sub-groups. 
A popular algorithm, called decision tree, works exactly in this way. Ultimately, the tree divides the customers into eights groups for which we compute the number of customers and default percentage.
The following chart shows the tree.</p>
